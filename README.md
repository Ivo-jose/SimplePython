# My Python Project

This project contains two example files written in Python: a traditional script (`exemple-1.py`) and a Jupyter notebook (`exemple-2.ipynb`).

## Project Structure

- **`exemple-1.py`**: A simple script that prints messages to the console and displays some variables.
- **`exemple-2.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook containing code and markdown cells for learning Python.

## File Contents

### `exemple-1.py`
This file performs the following actions:
- Displays "Hello World!"
- Defines and prints an age variable
- Displays a Python test message
- Defines and prints the name of a course

### `exemple-2.ipynb`
The notebook contains:
- A Markdown cell with the phrase "Learning Python"
- A code cell that prints "Hello World!"
- A code cell that performs a mathematical operation (`5 + 4`)

## How to Run

### Running the Python Script
To execute the `exemple-1.py` file, use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python exemple-1.py
```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook
To open and run the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you don't have it:
   ```sh
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. In the browser, open `exemple-2.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook to run the `.ipynb` file

## License
This project is just an example and does not have a specific license.
